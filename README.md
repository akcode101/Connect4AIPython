Connect 4 AI using alpha-beta pruning of a limited depth (&lt;15) and an evaluation function


In this project, I worked on a Connect 4 AI that used alpha-beta pruning and an evaluation fn. to find a decently good move. At the moment, this AI is not perfect, due to its 
limited depth but paired up with the evaluation function it's fairly good. I tested the AI using the Python IDLE interpreter, because I found Python the easiest language to
implement recursive functions. Currently, the game of Connect 4 is already solved, and there is already a great perfect connect-4 AI on http://connect4.gamesolver.org/
made by Pascal Pons. I used several of his ideas in the implementation of my own AI.
